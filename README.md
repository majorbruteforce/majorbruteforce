### Hello 🙋‍♂️

I like understanding how systems work on a low level. I’m currently exploring operating systems, computer networks, databases, and how OOP is done in practice, while also implementing data structures and algorithms to better understand how the things we use actually work.

Most of my experience has been writing web backends in JavaScript and TypeScript, but lately I’ve been more interested in building systems in C++ and Go. I’m also drawn to cloud technologies and the design of high-performance systems. Sometimes, I enjoy exploring math, data, and their implementations through code.

If you want to chat, reach me out through my socials!

P.S. I hate abstractions that I don't understand.
